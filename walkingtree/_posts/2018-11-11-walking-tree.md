title: "The Walking Tree"
---
I am the walking tree.  
One step it's here,  
The other I can't see.  

I am the walking tree.  
I have the safety of roots,  
I have freedom in my boots.  

I am the walking tree.  
Strength in the trunk,  
Speed in the roots dunk. 

I am the walking tree.  
I stay and I leave to be.
