<p>I am the walking tree.<br />
One step it’s here,<br />
The other I can’t see.</p>

<p>I am the walking tree.<br />
I have the safety of roots,<br />
I have freedom in my boots.</p>

<p>I am the walking tree.<br />
Strength in the trunk,<br />
Speed in the roots dunk.</p>

<p>I am the walking tree.<br />
I stay and I leave to be.</p>
