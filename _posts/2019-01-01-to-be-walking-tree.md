title: "To be walking tree"
---
To be a walking tree is to have the deep force of nature, the gigantic presence of an ancient trunk, and the great shadow drawn by the leaves that protect us and our loved ones.  
To be a walking tree is to have the freedom to live in the world, to walk us and our emotions, bringing the presence of the trunk and our clothes of leaves as we are, where we go.  
To be stable through our strong and calm expression like a deep-rooted tree.  
To be the movement through a conscious path, drawn with our pencil and with our whole being.  
To have the ability to embrace us, nature, and be happy in the expression of our leaves and in the freedom of our movement.
